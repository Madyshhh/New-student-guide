                <h3>Understanding the timetable:</h3>
                <p>After you have sucsessfully enroled, chosed your modules and module groups, you will have your
                    personalised timetable, which you will be
                    able to access through University app. You will only have to attend the labs and seminars you have
                    chosen. <br><br>
                    <span class="important">Note</span>, it is easy to get overwhelmed by looking a the full timetable
                    for the modules, as that will show you all the labs, all the seminars, but you
                    don`t have to attend them all, only the ones you chose.

                <h3>Understanding the lecture types:</h3>
                <p>There is different type of lectures/classes for each module. Some modules might not have tutorials
                    and only have labs, for example.
                    All modules will have lectures, but they might be pre-recorder in videos, which would mean, you
                    don`t have to attend university, you can watch them online through Canvas. But that depends on the
                    module and lecturers. <br>
                    Here is an explanation of each type of class:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-box">
                <h3>Lectures</h3>
                <p>Lectures is a presentation intended to present information or teach a particular subject to a full
                    class.
                    <br>Lectures are used to present critical information, history, background, theories and equations.
                    <br>
                    It is very important to take notes during lectures. <br><br>
                    <span class="important">Note</span>, that after covid, instead of lectures you might be required to
                    watch pre-recorded videos.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-box">
                <h3>Labs</h3>
                <p>Labs are done for smaller groups of people. They allow for hands-on practical work on something. <br>
                    In labs, you can ask questions to the lecturer, as that is not done in the lectures. <br><br>
                    Usually, you will need to prepare for a lab in advance and you need to attend them once a week.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-box">
                <h3>Seminars</h3>
                <p>In seminars questions are explored, views are debated and analysed and students are expected to
                    contribute to the discussion with the lecturer and other students. <br><br>
                    You will need to prepare for the seminars in advance, so you could have a discussion about a
                    particular topic. <br><br>
                    Seminars usually happen every second week.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-box">
                <h3>Tutorials</h3>
                <p>Tutorials are similar to labs, they are done in small groups with opportunity to ask questions to the
                    lecturer. <br>
                    Tutorials allow you to develop a better understanding of topics and integrate ideas from your
                    reading and lectures. <br><br>
                    Usually, you have to attend them once a week.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Grid elements -->
            <div class="grid-box-span">
                <h3>Marking your attendance:</h3>
                <p>You can mark your attendance by University app, navigating to "My attendance". Lecturer will provide
                    you an attendace code
                    which you will need to enter for the particular class. <br>
                    If you have problems marking attendence, lecturer can do it for you.<br><br>
                    <span class="important">Note</span>, it is important to mark your attendence in the first 15 minutes
                    of the class, as you won`t be able to do it later.
                </p>
