        <p>Our 330-acre campus isn't just a gorgeous place to call home. With an Olympic-sized swimming pool, on-site
            cinema and more than a dozen restaurants, bars and delis, it’s easy to see why we’ve earned a five-star
            rating for our facilities in the QS World Rankings.</p>

                <h3>Getting to the campus:</h3>
                <p>The University of Stirling’s campus is just two miles from the centre of Stirling in central
                    Scotland. We're served by excellent fast public transport links from Glasgow and Edinburgh, and are
                    easily accessible by bus, foot and bike from Stirling city centre or Bridge of Allan. <br><br>
                    The Unilink shuttle bus between Stirling centre, the train station and the main University campus is
                    the one of the handiest and most regular services. Most bus services to the campus run from either
                    just outside Stirling's Rail Station or a two minute walk away, in Murray Place. <br><br>

                    Visitors to the University who choose to bring their car should note the following directions: <br>

                    From the East, South or West take the M9 to Junction 11. At the junction, there is a roundabout
                    which marks the end of the M9. From here you should take the exit for Bridge of Allan, follow the
                    road through the town itself, and after about 200 metres you will find the University entrance on
                    the left. <br>

                    From the North take the A9 to the same roundabout and follow the same route through Bridge of Allan
                    as above. <br><br>

                    Park in a designated parking space. Possession of a valid permit does not guarantee a parking space.
